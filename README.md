# Workout Tracker

## My Repository

In this GitHub repository, you will find my workout tracker web application, created using MongoDB and deployed via heroku. The purpose of this application is to enable users to track workouts, including things like having multiple exercises in each workout, multiple workouts and graphs to display workout data.

## Installation

This application does not need to be installed, as it can be viewed live on Heroku at the following URL. [https://bjp-workout-tracker.herokuapp.com](https://bjp-workout-tracker.herokuapp.com)

## Software Used

The development of this project was completed using Visual Studio Code, with MongoDB Robo3T to view the database and collections on my local machine, and then MongoDB Atlas to deploy the application on Heroku.

## Conclusion

I really enjoyed learning more about MongoDB through the development of this application, as well as solidifying my knowledge and abilities in creating Mongo-based applications. I look forward to the next challenge.
